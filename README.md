## About
This web-app is made as hobby to improve web-developing skills and deepen my understanding of basic tools for both front- and 
backend developing. Currently this app is running on heroku url: https://arcane-beyond-54795.herokuapp.com/#/login and it provides
simple chat functionality with different rooms user can join and create. In the future there might be kind of a blog service as
well.
